# DSA-Programs
Welcome to my DSA practice repository 👨‍💻
This repo contains problems and solutions I’ve solved while learning core Data Structures & Algorithms concepts step by step.

The goal is to build strong problem-solving logic, not just memorize solutions.
🚀 Topics Covered So Far
🧮 1. Basic Array Problems

Fundamental array manipulation and traversal.
Programs solved:

Reverse an array

Find largest / second largest element

Move all zeros to the end

Two Sum (basic version)

Concepts learned:

Loop control

Swapping elements

Index handling

Brute force vs optimized thinking

🔁 2. Two Pointers Technique

Using two indices to reduce time complexity.

Problems practiced:

Reverse array using two pointers

Palindrome string check

Two Sum (sorted & unsorted variations)

Key idea:
Instead of nested loops (O(n²)), use two pointers to achieve O(n) solutions.

🪟 3. Sliding Window – Fixed Size

Window size remains constant.

Problems solved:

Maximum sum subarray of size K

Maximum average subarray of size K

Key concepts:

Reusing previous window sum

Avoiding recomputation

Time complexity reduced from O(n²) → O(n)

🪟 4. Sliding Window – Variable Size

Window expands and shrinks based on conditions.

Problems practiced:

Longest substring without repeating characters

Longest substring with at most K distinct characters

Longest subarray with sum ≤ K

Key concepts:

Expand with right pointer

Shrink with left pointer when condition breaks

Maintaining window validity

🧠 5. HashMap & Frequency Counting

Tracking counts inside sliding windows.

Problems solved:

Character frequency tracking

Substring problems with constraints

Introduction to frequency-based window logic

Key concepts:

HashMap<Character, Integer>

Counting vs presence tracking

Dynamic window state

🧩 6. Kadane-style Logic (Product Variant)

Handling sign-sensitive problems.

Problem solved:

Maximum Product Subarray

Key learning:
Tracking both maximum and minimum product because:

Negative × Negative = Positive

🛠️ Skills Developed

✔ Writing optimized solutions
✔ Reducing time complexity
✔ Understanding patterns instead of memorizing
✔ Building logic step by step
✔ Clean coding practice in Java

📈 Learning Approach

I follow a structured path:
